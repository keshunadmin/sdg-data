Until methodology or standards have been agreed we are reporting/linking to the most relevant source of information.\n\nThis indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator and has been identified in collaboration with topic experts. We will work to develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification.\n\nData availability within the UK is limited to England for this indicator.\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals is a collaborative project, if you have any feedback or suggestions for data please contact us at <SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk>\n"}
