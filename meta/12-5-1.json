Until methodology or standards have been agreed we are reporting/linking to the most relevant source of information.\n\nThis indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator and has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts. We will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification.\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals is a collaborative project, if you have any feedback or suggestions for data please contact us at <SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk>\n"}
