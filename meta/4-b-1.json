The World Bank, IMF and UNDP participate as observers. Official development assistance (ODA): The DAC defines ODA as \u201cthose flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent) (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm). Other official flows (OOF): Other official flows (excluding officially supported export credits) are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCDDAC(2016)3FINAL.pdf - Para 24). Bilateral Aid:  Bilateral aid covers all aid provided by donor countries when the recipient country, sector or project is known. Bilateral aid also includes aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where the government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds will be spent on. Multilateral Aid:  This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations. Purpose Codes: The DAC (Development Assistance Committee) Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases.  In addition, these codes are used to classify information in the DAC databases. The sector classification codes used can be found on the OECD website (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm). Scholarships: Financial aid awards for individual students and contributions to trainees. The beneficiary students and trainees are nationals of developing countries. Financial aid awards include bilateral grants to students registered for systematic instruction in private or public institutions of higher education to follow full-time studies or training courses in the donor country. Estimated tuition costs of students attending schools financed by the donor but not receiving individual grants are not included here, but under item imputed student costs (CRS sector code 1520). Training costs relate to contributions for trainees from developing countries receiving mainly non-academic, practical or vocational training in the donor country.","computation_calculations":"The total volume of official development assistance flows for post-secondary education falls under DAC 5 Code 114.","comments_limitations":"The figures for the indicator were obtained by using the \u201cSUMIFS\u201d function to gather figures from the \u201cdata underlying SID 2016\u201d dataset.","un_designated_tier":"1","un_custodian_agency":"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-04-0B-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 211 KB)","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Department for International Development (DfID)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"2009","source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/statistics-on-international-development-2016","source_url_text_1":"Statistics on International Development 2016","source_release_date_1":"17-11-2016","source_next_release_1":"17-11-2017","source_statistical_classification_1":"National Statistic","source_contact_1":"enquiry@dfid.gov.uk, Telephone (UK only), 0300 200 3343","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_text_3":"Link to Source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to Source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to Source","reporting_status":"complete","published":true,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Flow of official development assistance (ODA) for post-secondary education","graph_type":"line","data_show_map":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_6":true,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","national_data_update_url_text":"2017-10-27: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/a56c95deb7a7f276c4a3300d5d78c4f6fe166448","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2018-10-11: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/c65d1a32b45b64ac6ce41dcc156ca91d3079e511","page_content":"This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator and has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
