They represent the ratio of the indicator value for one group to that of the other. Typically, the likely more disadvantaged group is placed in the numerator. A value of exactly 1 indicates parity between the two groups.","computation_calculations":"The indicator value of the likely more disadvantaged group is divided by the indicator value of the other sub-population of interest.","data_footnote":"Several of the GPI and GPIA values are marked 'UIS Estimation' on the source data. Low GPIA values do not represent a property of the GPIA calculation, but are due to low values of the male/female rates.
