We have therefore identified relevant policy/legislation by country, as well as the official curriculum and some supporting case studies.\n\n*England*\n\n[National Curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum)\n\n*Northern Ireland*\n\n[Overview of the Northern Ireland Curriculum](http://ccea.org.uk/curriculum/overview)\n\n*Scotland*\n\n[Curriculum for Excellence](http://www.gov.scot/resource/doc/226155/0061245.pdf) and [Learning for Sustainability (DOC 33 KB)](http://www.gov.scot/resource/0041/00416172.docx)\n\n*Wales*\n\n[Curriculum](http://learning.gov.wales/resources/improvementareas/curriculum/?lang=en), [Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2015/2/contents/enacted) (see Goal 4 in particular) and [Education for Sustainable Development and Global Citizenship](http://learning.gov.wales/resources/browse-all/education-for-sustainable-development-and-global-citizenship/?lang=en)\n\nA support document showing relevant ESD case studies can be found in [\u2018Good practice in Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in the UK: Case Studies\u2019 (PDF 165 KB)](https://www.unesco.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/UKNC-Case-Study-1-FINAL.pdf).\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals is a collaborative project, if you have any feedback or suggestions please contact us at <SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk>.\n"}
